ultraindia_title;Raise the UltraIndia Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ultraindia_desc;With the Prussian threat to our borders defanged for now, India divided, and the Ming on the brink of collapse, we now have a perfect opportunity to finally focus the brunt of our attention to the rich lands of the Orient we've long considered secondary to our interests in Europe. Of particular interest to our merchants in the Bengal region are the Kalian highlands, home to scores of mountain tribes keen on raiding our coastal concessions, vast forests of valuable teakwood, and the key to permanently securing our position in the Far East. However, while there's no doubt we'll be able to bring Kale to heel on their own, the Kingdom of Kale is still technically a tributary of the Ming Empire and, though weakened as they are, it's doubtful that the Chinese will simply abandon their tributaries while their right to rule is under growing scrutiny. Our minister have been warned that another long, protracted war with the Ming in the Kalian jungles and mountains could prove ruinous for our frail economy. Demanding Ming withdrawal would simplify matters considerably but, should they refuse, we shall have to prepare for the worst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC7790001;The Southeast Asia is a harsh land, covered in dense jungles, rugged mountains, and vast rivers. Borders in this region are hard to agree on, harder to accurately map, and near impossible to enforce.\nThe latter two are what we are now using to legitimise our push into the Kalian highlands in violation of our earlier treaty with the Ming Empire. While Nanjing is unlikely to be appeased by our justifications, it does give the battered empire an out of the situation while saving us the trouble of a large-scale land war in Asia.\nAll we have left to do is wait for our representative in Nanjing to bring back the Chinese Emperor's response...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTOPTB7790001;Jungle warfare in Southeast Asia? Maybe that's not the best idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC7790002;"...the border shall be delineated at the Mekong, with a demilitarised zone of 50 km enforced on both sides of the river for the sake of free trade and amity between our two Empires..." \n\nEver since their victory in 1812, French presence in Southeast Asia has been growing at an alarming rate. Now, the French ambassador has approached us with a humiliating 'offer to settle our respective spheres of influence': in short, surrender our tributary Kale in return for peace. Worse, it comes with the stipulation that this 'treaty' can be revised every 15 years without clearly stating what clauses can be revised and on what terms. The Kalians have in turn come to the Forbidden Palace, beseeching the Emperor punish the French for their arrogance. Yet, having lost to the French once already and with the growing Korean threat to the north, can we really spare the effort to fight another war with no clear benefit for us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME7790003;The Ming Refuse Our Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC7790003;As expected, the Ming have rejected our proposal outright and have openly declared their support for the Kingdom of Kale. We've but one option left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA7790003;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC7790004;Much to our pleasure, the Ming have agreed to our demands: Kale is ours to do as we see fit. And, as a bonus, we've retained our right to revise our sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, the island of Hainan shall be ceded to the French Empire as collatoral guaranteeing the maintainance of the treaty's guidelines for a duration of 99 years..."\n\nFor years, the Chinese have passed the results of the first Sino-French War off as a fluke. However, with our second victory over the Ming, it's clear that French military superiority over the Chinese has transcended mere warroom opinion and become indisputable truth. Backed by superior soldiers and more advanced arms, we're at liberty to enforce our full demands on UltraIndia and eastern trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC7790006;We have lost. Try as we might, we cannot ignore the red Kalian highlands, stained with the blood of thousands of our men, nor the thundering barbarian guns that painted the mountains with gusto. While our generals bicker over the cause of our defeat, whether the Kalians betrayed us or poor decision making by field commanders, all we can do is wait and see the fallout of this inauspicious day;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC7790007;One last crack of gunpowder rang out in the air before it became clear that the only French flags left were those black and red, trampled into the mud and soaked through with French blood. In the distance, grand French ships sat impotently far from the coast, slowly turning westward. A moment of silence, of bated breath, gave way to a grand wave of cheers heard throughout every valley in the Kalian highlands: OUR HOMELAND! OUR FREEDOM! VICTORY AT LAST!\n\nWith this great victory, we've both demolished the French position in Southeast Asia and proven to the world the era of the Ming is far from over. Our hegemony over Southeast Asia now confirmed, we can expel the foreign dogs from our subjects' lands and revive our Mandate to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC7790008;So much blood, so much gold, for nothing more than a scrap of paper taking away our lands and influence in Southeast Asia. It seems our imperial ambitions in this region must, at least for the time, come to an end.

hainan_treaty_port_desc;The city of Zhuya (Shore of Pearls), name for the famous pearl fisheries of the region, now known as Qiongshan is an important stop to Shanghai and Formosa.

weihaiwei_treaty_port_desc;The port of Weihaiwei serves as the base for the Beiyang Fleet (Northern Seas Fleet) for the Qing Dynasty.

hong_kong_treaty_port_title;The Hong Kong Treaty Port;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hong_kong_treaty_port_desc;China is the main supplier of its native tea to Europe, whose annual domestic consumption reached 30,046,935 pounds (13,629,060 kg) in 1830, an average of 1.036 pounds (0.470 kg) per head of population. From the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ economic standpoint, Chinese tea was a crucial item since it provides massive wealth for the taipans — foreign (especially $COUNTRY_ADJ$) businessmen in China — while the duty on tea accounted for 10% of the government's income. With a base in Hong Kong our tea and opium trade will profit immensely and the city will, without a doubt, bring us a lot of profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ningbo was known as a trade city on the silk road at least two thousand years ago, and then as a major port, along with Yangzhou and Guangzhou in the Tang Dynasty, thereafter, the major ports for foreign trade in the Song Dynasty. A walled city sandwiched between the ocean and low-lying mountains to the southwest, with coastal plain and valleys in between, it plays an important role in controlling the important peninsulas of Chuanshan and Xiangshan Peninsula. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the textile industry flourished in Ningbo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheju_treaty_port_title;The Cheju Island Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheju_treaty_port_desc;The Cheju (or Jeju) island, south of Korea, lies in the Korea Strait between Japan and Korea. According to the local legend, three demigods emerged from Samsung which is said to have been on the northern slopes of Mt. Halla and became the progenitors of the Jeju people who founded the Kingdom of Tamna. During the Joseon Dynasty of Korea Jeju islanders were treated as foreigners and Jeju was considered as a place for horse breeding and exile for political prisoners. In the 17th Century, Injo of Joseon issued an edict prohibiting islanders from traveling to the Korean mainland. Despite the poverty, the Island would serve as a good base to exert influence over Korea and Japan and it's the place that's more likely to be ceded - the current owners don't care about it too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are three main islands plus a number of smaller islets that surround them and an isolated tiny islet.
