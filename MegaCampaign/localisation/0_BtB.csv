EVTDESC7790001;The Southeast Asia is a harsh land, covered in dense jungles, rugged mountains, and vast rivers. Borders in this region are hard to agree on, harder to accurately map, and near impossible to enforce.\nThe latter two are what we are now using to legitimise our push into the Kalian highlands in violation of our earlier treaty with the Ming Empire. While Nanjing is unlikely to be appeased by our justifications, it does give the battered empire an out of the situation while saving us the trouble of a large-scale land war in Asia.\nAll we have left to do is wait for our representative in Nanjing to bring back the Chinese Emperor's response...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC7790002;"...the border shall be delineated at the Mekong, with a demilitarised zone of 50 km enforced on both sides of the river for the sake of free trade and amity between our two Empires..." \n\nEver since their victory in 1812, French presence in Southeast Asia has been growing at an alarming rate. Now, the French ambassador has approached us with a humiliating 'offer to settle our respective spheres of influence': in short, surrender our tributary Kale in return for peace. Worse, it comes with the stipulation that this 'treaty' can be revised every 15 years without clearly stating what clauses can be revised and on what terms. The Kalians have in turn come to the Forbidden Palace, beseeching the Emperor punish the French for their arrogance. Yet, having lost to the French once already and with the growing Korean threat to the north, can we really spare the effort to fight another war with no clear benefit for us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME7790002;France Demands Kale;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME7790003;The Ming Refuse Our Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC7790003;\n\nAs expected, the Ming have rejected our proposal outright and have openly declared their support for the Kingdom of Kale. We've but one option left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA7790003;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME7790004;The Ming Concede Kale;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC7790004;Much to our pleasure, the Ming have agreed to our demands: Kale is ours to do as we see fit. And, as a bonus, we've retained our right to revise our sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC7790005;"...the Kingdoms of Kale and Hsipaw shall be under French guidance while the Kingdom of Lan Xang and the Sundanese Isles shall be made free and independent nations that shall conduct their own diplomatic agenda and operate without any interference from the Chinese Empire. Additionally, the island of Hainan shall be ceded to the French Empire as collatoral guaranteeing the maintainance of the treaty's guidelines for a duration of 99 years..."\n\nFor years, the Chinese have passed the results of the first Sino-French War off as a fluke. However, with our second victory over the Ming, it's clear that French military superiority over the Chinese has transcended mere warroom opinion and become indisputable truth. Backed by superior soldiers and more advanced arms, we're at liberty to enforce our full demands on UltraIndia and eastern trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC7790006;We have lost. Try as we might, we cannot ignore the red Kalian highlands, stained with the blood of thousands of our men, nor the thundering barbarian guns that painted the mountains with gusto. While our generals bicker over the cause of our defeat, whether the Kalians betrayed us or poor decision making by field commanders, all we can do is wait and see the fallout of this inauspicious day;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC7790007;One last crack of gunpowder rang out in the air before it became clear that the only French flags left were those black and red, trampled into the mud and soaked through with French blood. In the distance, grand French ships sat impotently far from the coast, slowly turning westward. A moment of silence, of bated breath, gave way to a grand wave of cheers heard throughout every valley in the Kalian highlands: OUR HOMELAND! OUR FREEDOM! VICTORY AT LAST!\n\nWith this great victory, we've both demolished the French position in Southeast Asia and proven to the world the era of the Ming is far from over. Our hegemony over Southeast Asia now confirmed, we can expel the foreign dogs from our subjects' lands and revive our Mandate to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC7790008;So much blood, so much gold, for nothing more than a scrap of paper taking away our lands and influence in Southeast Asia. It seems our imperial ambitions in this region must, at least for the time, come to an end.

EVTDESC160011;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern periphery of our empire. According to reports this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt and godless Ming Dynasty.

Even the soldiers bared grimaces as they set about to their king's command. A few men stood at the top of the church, securing the last of the ropes to the steeple. Seeing this, the crowd let out a collective cry, pleading and weeping, as if the nooses had been tied around their necks instead. Perhaps some might have even preferred that. Unmoved, the commander barked out a command and the soldiers began to pull the cords. Frantic and frenzied Christians surged forth, ramming into the lines of soldiers to save their god. But it was too late. \n\nWith a great crack, the golden cross atop Stockholm's grand cathedral fell to the smoldering ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
