MC_NAME;The Calm and the Storm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
MC_DESC;Though last cloud of gunpowder smoke over the Rhineland has dissipated for now, Europe stands on the precipice of a new age. After a century of rebellion and warfare, the upstart Bonaparte family has fended off both the liberal tide that allowed their initial rise to power and the reactionary response to their usurpation to cement their place as Emperors of France and hegemons of continental Europe. While peace seems assured so long as the Ancien R嶲imes remain stewing in defeat and licking their wounds, the ashes of the Revolution, though crushed and scattered to the four winds, still crackle with hope. From the misty far shores of the New World to the smoking war-ravaged Far East, discontent and oppression lay as kindling for the embers of human liberty, national fraternity, and liberalism to reignite into the greatest conflagration in human history. Prince Victor is 16 years old and will soon ascend to the throne of Napoleonic France, the greatest industrial empire ever to span the globe. His ascension to a long, prosperous, yet tumultuous reign will mark the beginning of an age that is to last all the way up until the First Great War. In this new era of unprecedented technological progress, doubts will be cast on certainties that have stood since time immemorial, and new dogmas will rise in their place. Far away, across the briny foam, the riches of Asia and Africa, and The Heart of Darkness, beckon that their songs may also be heard, in the Concert of Europe. Maestro, choose your instrument, and let the music play.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
