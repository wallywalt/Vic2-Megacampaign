This is to stop stuff like free Ireland in 1840 because of the militancy that the famine generates, among other weird crisis.

launch_highland_raids_title;Launch Raids against the French invaders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
launch_highland_raids_desc;The loss of our entire coastline to the French imperialists has left our country broken, both economically and militarily. But while the French have superior arms, they lack our intimate knowledge of our land's geography. By launching raids into the French occupation, we can cripple their operations in our lands and perhaps drive them back across the sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ultraindia_desc;With the Prussian threat to our borders defanged for now, India divided, and the Ming on the brink of collapse, we now have a perfect opportunity to finally focus the brunt of our attention to the rich lands of the Orient we've long considered secondary to our interests in Europe. Of particular interest to our merchants in the Bengal region are the Kalian highlands, home to scores of mountain tribes keen on raiding our coastal concessions, vast forests of valuable teakwood, and the key to permanently securing our position in the Far East. However, while there's no doubt we'll be able to bring Kale to heel on their own, the Kingdom of Kale is still technically a tributary of the Ming Empire and, though weakened as they are, it's doubtful that the Chinese will simply abandon their tributaries while their right to rule is under growing scrutiny. Our minister have been warned that another long, protracted war with the Ming in the Kalian jungles and mountains could prove ruinous for our frail economy. Demanding Ming withdrawal would simplify matters considerably but, should they refuse, we shall have to prepare for the worst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hainan_treaty_port_desc;The city of Zhuya (Shore of Pearls), name for the famous pearl fisheries of the region, now known as Qiongshan is an important stop to Shanghai and Formosa.

taipei_treaty_port_desc;The Taipei area is where the major Han Chinese settlements in northern Taiwan and one of the designated overseas trade ports, Tamsui, are located. The area gained economic importance due to the booming overseas trade, especially that of tea export. Controlling it would mean controlling Taiwan and a good amount of the tea trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

weihaiwei_treaty_port_desc;The port of Weihaiwei serves as the base for the Beiyang Fleet (Northern Seas Fleet) for the Qing Dynasty. Along with Lüshun, it provides a strategic point for the control of the Korea Bay and the Bohai Gulf.

shanghai_treaty_port_desc;For centuries a major administrative, shipping, and trading town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to European recognition of its favorable port location and economic potential.

hong_kong_treaty_port_title;The Hong Kong Treaty Port;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
hong_kong_treaty_port_desc;China is the main supplier of its native tea to Europe, whose annual domestic consumption reached 30,046,935 pounds (13,629,060 kg) in 1830, an average of 1.036 pounds (0.470 kg) per head of population. From the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ economic standpoint, Chinese tea was a crucial item since it provides massive wealth for the taipans — foreign (especially $COUNTRY_ADJ$) businessmen in China — while the duty on tea accounted for 10% of the government's income. With a base in Hong Kong our tea and opium trade will profit immensely and the city will, without a doubt, bring us a lot of profit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ningbo_treaty_port_desc;Ningbo is one of China's oldest cities, with a history dating to the Hemudu culture in 4800 BC. Ningbo was known as a trade city on the silk road at least two thousand years ago, and then as a major port, along with Yangzhou and Guangzhou in the Tang Dynasty, thereafter, the major ports for foreign trade in the Song Dynasty. A walled city sandwiched between the ocean and low-lying mountains to the southwest, with coastal plain and valleys in between, it plays an important role in controlling the important peninsulas of Chuanshan and Xiangshan Peninsula. During the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the textile industry flourished in Ningbo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheju_treaty_port_title;The Cheju Island Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cheju_treaty_port_desc;The Cheju (or Jeju) island, south of Korea, lies in the Korea Strait between Japan and Korea. According to the local legend, three demigods emerged from Samsung which is said to have been on the northern slopes of Mt. Halla and became the progenitors of the Jeju people who founded the Kingdom of Tamna. During the Joseon Dynasty of Korea Jeju islanders were treated as foreigners and Jeju was considered as a place for horse breeding and exile for political prisoners. In the 17th Century, Injo of Joseon issued an edict prohibiting islanders from traveling to the Korean mainland. Despite the poverty, the Island would serve as a good base to exert influence over Korea and Japan and it's the place that's more likely to be ceded - the current owners don't care about it too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okinawa_treaty_port_title;The Chongsheng Island Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
okinawa_treaty_port_desc;Chongsheng Island is the largest of the Liuqiu Islands and the heart of one of the prime trade routes between China, UltraIndia, and the Japanese Isles. Aside from the mercantile influence control of the island would afford us, Chongsheng's proximity to the major nations of the Far East would allow us sufficient naval range to supply future endeavours in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
zanzibar_treaty_port_title;The Zanzibar Island Concession;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
zanzibar_treaty_port_desc;Zanzibar, coming from zangi, a Persian name of a local people, said to mean "black," and the Persian bar, which means coast or shore. The Zanzibar Archipelago consists of several islands lying off the coast of East Africa in the Indian Ocean. There are three main islands plus a number of smaller islets that surround them and an isolated tiny islet. Zanzibar is the center of the Arab slave trade and projects its power over a long strip of land in Eastern Africa. It would serve as an excellent base of operations and coaling station in East Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

socotra_treaty_port_desc;A small archipelago of four islands in the Indian Ocean, Socotra has been inhabited since the 1st-century AD, appearing as Dioskouridou ("of the Dioscuri") in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a Greek navigation aid. The main city of the island is called Hadibu and with a garrison, a fort and a port, the island would be an ideal place for a coaling station for our ships coming and going from India and Eastern Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

form_russia_title;Reform the Rus;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_russia_desc;Centuries divided between the accursed nomads of the east and the treacherous Germanics in the west have all led up to this. Centuries of languishing under foreign occupation, centuries of fighting to preserve our culture and our legacy have given us the strength to bring our brethren together under the greatest Slavic empire in the East of the last thousand years. With our people reunified at last, it's finally time to throw off the Tatar yoke and reform the Rus!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_severnoslavia_title;Unify Lech, Czech, and Rus;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_severnoslavia_desc;In the distant past, the three Slav brothers - Lech, Czech, and Rus - parted ways to found their respective nations. And what a mistake that was. Divided, we Slavs have been subject to all manner of foreign depredation without the strength to fight back - or even to protect ourselves. But even those hardships may have been a blessing in diguise, for our struggles for independence against the Nords and the Tatars have brought us camaraderie with our likewise suffering, likewise struggling brethren in the west. We stand now poised to correct our forebearers' mistake and reunify the Slavs under one Slavic banner, one Slavic nation to retake our homelands for the sake of all Slavs - past, present, and still yet to come!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_zapadoslavia_title;Unite the Western Slavs;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_zapadoslavia_desc;Despite all our past conflicts, we Poles, Czechs, and Slovaks are not all that dissimilar: we are all blessed peoples with rich culture stuck in hard times as of late, we have been strong enough to stand the twin tests of time and foreign occupation, and - above all - we are Slavic brothers long estranged. But no longer. With each other at our sides, let us stand shoulder to shoulder against the world's depredations with all the Slavic courage that has let us endure this long. Let us make a toast and bring an end to our unjust divorce, Pan. Here's to Ceska, here's to Polska, here's to Slovensko, and here's to our futures united!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

economic_nationalism_desc;The aim of this policy is to have a country that is economically independent and nationally self-sufficient.

revive_norse_desc;At our height, the word 'Viking' would strike fear in the hearts of men as far as Jerusalem and fill our halls with great hordes of gold. Yet, despite all our efforts and our meteoric rise to the global stage, our people have not been able to inspire the same fear and awe that our raiding and pillaging forefathers did in the rest of Europe.

form_japan_title;Reunify Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
form_japan_desc; A thousand years of disunity. Of internal strife, of weakening our people for the sake of ephemeral glories. Such petty squabbles of petty lords have fractured our islands and allowed outsiders to plant their flags and armies on our fields, our castles, our homes while we have lived thus, divided and weak, cowed and submissive, trembling like children during a long, dark night. But no longer. For the night is over and a new day is dawning, a new era where the Japanese Islands stand strong and independent, united under our banners. Under this new sun and led by the Chrysanthemum throne, we will once again command our own destiny!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sell_espange_desc;Our strangehold of the Iberian peninsula has ensured security to the south for decades. However, growing Iberian nationalism and threats to other directions are making our hold over Espange untenable. We could continue to linger in the Iberian quagmire and hope for the best or sell the crown to Portugal, both to remove ourselves from the situation and hopefully reconcile our two nations for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

embrace_gyushuans_KOR_desc;The nine provinces of the island of Gyushu exist in limbo. Too Japanese for their Korean overlords, too Korean for their Japanese brethren across the strait, Gyushuans eke out a decent, yet marginal exsitence between two ancient cultures, desired by both but accepted by neither. As such, their loyalty is questionable and could easily be swayed to either side, given satisfactory concessions. Certainly, centuries of Korean rule have made Gyushu an integral part of our realm and its people our citizens in all but name.

Too Japanese for their Korean overlords, too Korean for their Japanese brethren across the strait, Gyushuans eke out a decent, yet marginal exsitence between two ancient cultures. As such, their loyalty is questionable and could easily be swayed to either side, given a satisfactory concession. While Gyushuans share an uncomfortable amount of similarities with their former masters across the strait, at heart they are our brethren.
