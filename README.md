# Vic2-Megacampaign: Beyond the Barricade

The 3rd installment of another CK2=>EU4=>Victoria 2 Megacampaign.

The world of Beyond the Barricade in the year 1821:

Having suffering decades of religious disunity and economic chaos, the Kingdom of France fell to Revolution, shifting from kingdom to republic to empire in the course of a few years. Under the House of Bonaparte, the French Empire clawed its way from the brink, pushing its borders in every direction, and has cemented its place as the predominant, though far from uncontested, global power. 

On the other side of Europe, Russia remained subjugated by the Tatars, though the northern regions have gained independence with the help of foreign powers. The Ferganan Khaganate remains a force to be reckoned with, though changes in military strategy and the rise of nationalism will challenge the Great Khan's authority in the world's largest empire. 

Despite unifying most of the German princelings of Northern Europe, the Kingdom of Prussia still teeters from its most recent defeat to the alliance of the French Empire and the Kingdom of Scandinavia. With the Rhineland and Schleswig-Holstein now lost to its enemies, German reunification has taken a sizeable blow. Yet, with how close the German peoples are to full unification, this loss 

The United Kingdom of England, Scotland, and Ireland has spent the last few centuries in relative isolation from the mainland, instead focusing on dominating the New World, claiming lands from Philadelphia to the Falkland Islands. Yet, such colonial growth is not without consequence as the New World's population and economic output is starting to rival that of the metropole. Colonial policy and identity will be put to the test as the UK proceeds into the era of nationalism and liberalism.


The Kingdom of Jerusalem has cemented itself in the void left by the Eastern Roman Empire. By accepting the Hungarian prince as a guest in Constantinople, peace in Eastern Europe seems fleeting at best. 

In the East, China and India have suffered massive blows from both East and West, with the Korean Hwaryeong Kingdom pushing southward and the French pushing along the coast of the Bay of Bengal. 

Note: Add more lore here.

Work (at least mostly) finished: cleaning up cores and European+North African+Middle Eastern borders, using prettier map textures, editing nation colours, fixing tech levels in Europe, adding different classes of acquire state CBs (so 10K POP Gibraltar doesn't cost as much as all of Bohemia in terms of infamy)

WIP: cleaning up borders and tags (especially in South+East+SE Asia, the New World, Africa), adding in flavour events and decisions, borrowing the reforms structure and UI from HPM, reworking westernisation, adding in army and navy units, POPs in general, Congress system for determining infamy and army attrition, etc.
