# Vic2-Megacampaign: Beyond the Barricade

The 3rd installment of another CK2=>EU4=>Victoria 2 Megacampaign.

The world of Beyond the Barricade in the year 1821:

Having suffering decades of religious disunity and economic chaos, the Kingdom of France fell to Revolution, shifting from kingdom to republic to empire in the course of a few years. Under the House of Bonaparte, the French Empire clawed its way from the brink, pushing its borders in every direction, and has cemented its place as the predominant, though far from uncontested, global power. 

Across the Dover Strait, the United Kingdom of England, Scotland, and Ireland has spent the last few centuries in relative isolation from the mainland, instead focusing on dominating the New World from Philadelphia to the Falkland Islands. Yet, such colonial growth is not without consequence as the New World's population and economic output is starting to rival that of the metropole. Colonial policy and identity will be put to the test as the UK proceeds into the era of nationalism and liberalism.

On the other side of Europe, Russia remained subjugated by the Tatars, though the northern regions have gained independence with the help of foreign powers. The Ferganan Khaganate remains a force to be reckoned with, though changes in military strategy and the rise of nationalism will challenge the Great Khan's authority in the world's largest empire. 

The situation in the heart of Europe is hardly any more tenable as German nationalism still smolders in the wake of Scandinavian unfication. 

In the far north, Swedish steel has brought unity to the long divided Nordic kingdoms, secured a foothold in the New World, and even scored a major victory against Prussian encrouchment in the Baltic. With such success still in recent memory, Stockholm looks to the remaining coasts of the Baltic Sea, now seemingly well within reach. Further conflict with the Germans and Russians seems imminent, the only questions left are when and if Scandinavia can survive the coming storm. 

Meanwhile, despite unifying most of the German princelings of Northern Europe, the Kingdom of Prussia still teeters from its most recent defeat to the alliance of the French Empire and the Kingdom of Scandinavia. With the Rhineland and Schleswig-Holstein now lost to its enemies, German reunification has taken a sizeable blow. Yet, with how close the German peoples are to full unification, this loss may only have further galvanised German nationalists across all of Europe and Northern Africa, convincing that a reunified German nation the only chance of their people's survival. 

Likewise, the Italian Kingdom burns as a hotspot of unfulfilled nationalism as French and Carinthian imperialism has shorn the northern peninsula clean off. A single misstep by either empire may alter the entire balance of power in Central Europe.

The English-born Portuguese Empire lies in a sorry state; empire in name only, Portugal's colonies sit scattered and second-rate to their rivals' and its lands in Iberia reduced to a fraction of its former influence. Yet Portugal still retains the exiled Holy See in the Algarve and Espangian nationalism, coupled with French economic insolvency, promises much for the long-suffering empire.

The Kingdom of Jerusalem has cemented itself in the void left by the Eastern Roman Empire. With lands from the Red Sea to the Black, Jerusalemite dreams of a full Mare Nostrum seem to be coming to fruition. The invitation of the exiled Hungarian prince as a guest in Constantinople promises as much, yet it remains to be seen if the other Great Powers will tolerate the advance long enough for Jerusalem to become too strong to be stopped.

The Croatian Carinthian Empire still lounges in relative prosperity, having not faced the worst that nationalism offers yet. Yet, with hungry neighbors to all sides and South Slavic brothers agitating across the Danubian frontier, nationalism is sure to come to Carinthia, one way or another. 

In the East, China and India have suffered massive blows from both East and West, with the Korean Hwaryeong Kingdom pushing southward and the French pushing along the coast of the Bay of Bengal. 

Note: Add more lore here.

Work (at least mostly) finished: cleaning up cores and European+North African+Middle Eastern borders, using prettier map textures, editing nation colours, fixing tech levels in Europe, adding different classes of acquire state CBs (so 10K POP Gibraltar doesn't cost as much as all of Bohemia in terms of infamy)

WIP: cleaning up borders and tags (especially in South+East+SE Asia, the New World, Africa), adding in flavour events and decisions, borrowing the reforms structure and UI from HPM, reworking westernisation, adding in army and navy units, POPs in general, Congress system for determining infamy and army attrition, etc.
